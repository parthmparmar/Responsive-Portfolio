            <p>My name is Parth Parmar and the best way to describe myself is a student of life.  I love to learn new things and take on new challenges.  Having a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from Clemson University has giving the great skill of how to learn and learn fast.  Over the years I have taught myself lots of different skills and acquired knowledge on a wide array of fields like: subtractive manufacturing (turning, milling, grinding, honing, wire EDM, sinker EDM, forming, etc.), additive manufacturing / 3D printing (FDM, SLS, SLA, DLSM, Muli Jet, Poly Jet and Binder Jet), quality systems, lean strategies, and many more.</p>
            <p>My latest area of focus / learning is the in web development, to be specific, full-stack web development.  In college I learned how to create programs by writing code in Matlab and instantly saw the benefits of coding.  I believe coding like the English language will be a must have as a professional skill set.  Next I dove into VBA to automate business processes at my first two jobs, specifically in Excel and Access.  Currently I am taking a full-stack web development bootcamp class at UNC and learning the challenging skills required to deploy a dynamic website. </p>
